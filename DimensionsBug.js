This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions.  The `Dimensions` API returns an object with `width` and `height` properties, but if you try to access these properties before the component has mounted, or before the `Dimensions` API has had time to update, you'll get `undefined`. This often leads to unexpected behavior or crashes, especially if you use the dimensions to calculate layout or styles.
